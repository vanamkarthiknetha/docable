## üß† Approach & Decisions

I used Tiptap v2 with React to build a minimal, Notion-style editor that supports basic formatting and block-level editing. My goal was to implement core writing features in a clean and modular way.

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented
- **Basic text formatting**: bold, italic, code, and headings
- **Block support**: paragraphs, headings (H1, H2), and bullet lists
- **Slash command menu**: triggered by /, allowing users to insert blocks easily
- **Markdown export**: implemented as an optional feature for exporting editor content

### üîß Key Decisions
- **Tiptap + StarterKit**: Used Tiptap's StarterKit to quickly integrate common editing functionality and ensure stability
- **Slash Menu with 3rd-party Package**: Integrated a third-party Tiptap-compatible package to simplify the implementation and provide a clean dropdown UI
- **Modular Design**: Components were separated for better code organization, making it easier to extend functionality in the future
- **Minimal Styling**: Focused on functionality over visual design, keeping the interface simple and distraction-free, as per the task instructions

This approach allowed me to meet all the core requirements while also adding markdown export support as a bonus feature.
